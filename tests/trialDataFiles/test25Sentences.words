About 400,000 commuters trying to find their$ way through the Bay area 's quake-torn transportation system wedged cheek-to-jowl into subways . sat in traffic jams on major freeways or waited forlornly for buses yesterday .
In other words . it was a better-than-average Manhattan commute .
City officials feared widespread gridlock on the first day that normal business operations were resumed following last Tuesday 's earthquake .
The massive temblor . which killed at least 61 people . severed the Bay Bridge . a major artery to the east . and closed most ramps leading to and from Highway 101 . the biggest artery to the south .
It will take several weeks to repair the bridge . and several months to repair some of the 101 connections .
But in spite of a wind-driven rainstorm . gridlock never materialized . mainly because the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system carried 50 % more passengers than normal .
For the first time in memory . it was standing-room only in BART 's sleek . modern railcars .
Moreover . the two main bridges still connecting San Francisco with the East Bay did n't charge tolls . allowing traffic to zip through without stopping .
Officials also suspect that traffic benefited from steps by major employers to get workers to come in at odd hours . or that many workers are still staying at home .
Many commuters who normally drove across the Bay Bridge . which is shut down for several weeks because of damage to one span . actually may have reached work a bit faster on BART yesterday . provided they could find a parking space at the system 's jammed stations .
In the best of times . the Bay Bridge is the worst commute in the region . often experiencing back-ups of 20 to 30 minutes or more .
Not that getting into town was easy .
Storm flooding caused back-ups on the freeway . and many commuters had to find rides to BART 's stations . because parking lots were full before dawn .
Bus schedules were sometimes in disarray . stranding commuters such as Marilyn Sullivan .
Her commute from Petaluma . Calif. . normally takes an hour and 15 minutes . via the Golden Gate Bridge . which connects San Francisco with the North Bay area .
Yesterday . she was still waiting at a bus stop after three hours . trying to transfer to a bus going to the financial district .
` It 's worse than I thought . '.' she said .
` I do n't know where all the buses are . '.'
But while traffic was heavy early in the commute over the Golden Gate . by 8 a.m. it already had thinned out .
` It 's one of the smoothest commutes I 've ever had . '.' said Charles Catania . an insurance broker on the bus from Mill Valley in Marin County .
` It looks like a holiday .
I think a lot of people got scared and stayed home . '.'
However . a spokeswoman for BankAmerica Corp. said yesterday 's absenteeism at the bank holding company was no greater than on an average day .
At the San Mateo Bridge . which connects the San Francisco peninsula with the East Bay . police were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved .
` Everybody pretty much pitched in and cooperated . '.' said Stan Perez . a sergeant with the California Highway Patrol .
